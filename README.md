This is a simple wallpaper changer to be used with Dual Monitor tools
It will download the latest image from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day website
It ignores videos and you can set the date and other settings using the wallpaper.ini file

*Note: The number of monitors corresponds with the folder names in my case 1 - 4. Dual Monitor tools must be installed.
